            <br><br><h5><b>Initial glance</b></h5><br>
        From an initial glance, we do not see a clear significant improvement with either swap in comparison to the
        control.
        Let’s ignore the form-based swap data for a second. Here is what the scatterplot may have looked like if our
        sentiment-analysis-based swapping consistently led to
        higher points after five matches:

        </center>
        In this scenario, we can clearly group the red results as being higher than the blue results.
        While there may be some overlapping points which may indicate outliers, we could definitely run a paired t-test
        on (points earned)/(cost)
        for each data point above to confirm that there is a significant increase between the two sets.
        Ideally, if we also had our green data points for form-based swaps, it would be a clear lump in between the blue
        and red points.

        We do see some simulations successfully follow the pattern described above, so why do our results look so
        different?
        To find out, we can scrutinize each result and learn something about our algorithm.

        <br><br><h5><b>Each data point presents a different story</b></h5><br>

        Before we delve deeper, let me describe what the current algorithm is doing:
        <br>
        <br>1. Prior to each matchweek, I look for tweets from news sources containing the player’s first and last name.
        <br>2. I save the first five results found for each player.
        <br>3. I calculate the sentiment of those five tweets, and save the most negative tweet.
        <br>4. For the squad you chose, I pull the sentiment values for every player and find the lowest one.
        <br>5. For the player with the lowest sentiment value, I replace him.
        If the lowest sentiment value is zero (neutral) or positive (good), I do not make a replacement.
        <br>6. Repeat for next matchweek with the updated squad. <br><br>

        Each data point presents a different story, and many of them reveal weaknesses in our algorithm.
        However, they also show promise that sentiment analysis could be useful with some improvements.
        Here are a few examples:

        <br><br><b>1. False negatives in sentiment analysis </b><br>

        <center>
            <picture>
                <img class="img-fluid" src="https://antoniolee-personal.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/media/tweet_1.png">
            </picture>
        </center>

        <br>Certain tweets will be incorrectly classified as negative. In this scenario, ‘slowly firing himself’ caused
        this sentiment to be classified as negative.
        However, we know that the tweet above is actually a positive headline.
        To resolve this, we may want to try using the average sentiment value rather than the minimum.
        Using an average with a larger sample of tweets will get us closer to the true sentiment, as it will dampen the
        impacts of false negatives and false positives.<br><br>

        <b>2. Correct sentiment, unfair assessment </b><br>

        <center>
            <picture>
                <img class="img-fluid" src="https://antoniolee-personal.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/media/tweet_2.png">
            </picture>
        </center>

        <br>Would you swap a player if his hairstyle was unappealing? In this scenario, the tweet is correctly negative,
        but the magnitude of the negativity is very small. Furthermore, the tweet is subjective –
        many people would say a player’s hairstyle does not impact their performance.
        If we were to introduce hysteresis on our algorithm, we could define a substitution to be based on
        the count of negative tweets or the sum of the magnitude of negative tweets over a certain time period,
        mitigating this issue.
        <br><br>

        <b>3. Truth vs. speculation </b><br>

        <center>
            <picture>
                <img class="img-fluid" src="https://antoniolee-personal.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/media/tweet_3.png">
            </picture>
        </center>

        <br>A lot of sports news is speculation. In this scenario, the player missed out on training,
        and this was reported to communicate the possibility that he would miss the next match.
        However, Salah ended up playing, and also scored ten points.

        Certain news organizations and reporters have a higher propensity of reporting stories that may end up being
        unreliable.
        Assigning a reliability value to the author and using that to weigh the sentiment values of their tweets may
        also be effective in improving our algorithm.
        <br>


        <br><br><h5><b>Additional infrastructure required</b></h5><br>

        Aside from improving our algorithm, our results could have looked vastly different had we had the infrastructure
        to scrape more data for each simulation.
        Imagine we were evaluating the average sentiment of 20 tweets per player per round rather than taking the
        minimum sentiment of 5.
        The former value would handle anomalies and confirm severe headlines much better than the latter.
        The small matchweek count may also be obscuring the effects of our swapping.
        The differences of actively switching players would be more pronounced if the simulation ran for a full season,
        where tweets would catch injuries, transfers, and bans for players effectively.
        Unfortunately, handling this much data is not easy without the necessary infrastructure.
        Currently, the free version of Django limits the Postgres database to 10,000 rows. If we have 200 players in our
        database,
        and 10 matchweek rows per player, we are at 2000 rows. If we save 5 tweets per matchweek per player, we are
        already at 10,000 rows!
        You can see how quickly our data tables will grow if we wanted to simulate a full season, which has 38
        matchweeks and over 500 players.
        Performance would also be impacted. Our ETL process to scrape data can be described by a time complexity of
        O(player * (number of tweets) * matchweek)
        – for every player, we scrape a set amount of tweets, and we repeat this for every match week.
        This is easy to run when all these values are small, but increasing each will take its toll on the server
        without an increase in processing power and memory.

        <br><br><h5><b>A path forward</b></h5><br>

        In addition to the algorithm improvements mentioned earlier, there are a lot of cool opportunities to continue
        this project.
        It would be exciting to create a fully-functional bot, which can work real time to manage a squad in the current
        season.
        This would mean the algorithm would have to handle more features available in fantasy soccer,
        such as captaining a player (doubles a player’s points each matchweek), managing a bench (you can have three
        extra players each round to substitute for free),
        and playing special ‘chips’ that help you gain more points. Another interesting idea is including other sources
        of data.
        Twitter sentiment data can be combined with a lot more, including international fixtures, detailed player
        statistics per match, and team performance per stadium.
        It would be exciting to identify which features lead to the best algorithm, and which features are red herrings.
        <br>
        <br>
        For me, this project was a testament to the power of data when used correctly. It was fun to see all the pieces
        of this project
        come together, from tinkering with the client side display to defining an entire back-end to collect and process
        data.
        I hope that this gave you some insight on sentiment analysis, and I hope it
        encourages you to think about other ways that we could leverage data to solve problems.
