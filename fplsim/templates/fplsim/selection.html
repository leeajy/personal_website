    <p> Fantasy Soccer is an engaging online pastime where fans can display their soccer acuity and keep up with their favorite players.
        To play, the participant "buys" eleven players every matchweek, with the goal of selecting the best performers.
        For each player, points are given for achievements such as goals or assists, or deducted for errors such as goals conceded or yellow cards.
         <u><a href="https://fantasy.premierleague.com/help/rules">(Check out the Scoring section for full details).</a></u>
        Each week, you can substitute one player without a point penalty.

    <br><br>When I started playing two years ago with some of my ex-coworkers, I tried my best to choose the strongest lineup every week.
        However, there would be many occasions where my team would be ravaged by unexpected injuries or player drama.
        If I had heard about the news ahead of time, I could have used my free substitution to acquire more points each week.
        Rather than reading up on every player every week, I thought it would be neat to have program that could do this automatically.
    <br><br>Below is a simulator that explores this idea – it will look for news tweets about the players in your lineup,
        perform sentiment analysis on each tweet, and replace the player with the most “negative” tweet.
        We can compare this to simulations done with no substitutions, or substitutions based on player performance.
        Try it out yourself!
